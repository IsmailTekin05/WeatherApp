!!!WEATHER APP!!!

It shows current weather of captial cities of most countries. Also with temperature (in C and F), weather and icon for weather. I made this project for especially learn GUI with java and API usage. It is plain and
simple but still can have some optimization issues with some cities due to the slownes of API provider.

The codes organization can be improved but this project is obviously small but I still applied Clean Code methods for some parts and I tried to make my code understandable in degree where only thing you need to
understand my code is sufficent java knowledge.
